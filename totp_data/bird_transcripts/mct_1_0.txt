there are two children and their mother in the kitchen
the little boy has climbed up on a three legged stool to get some biscuits from the jar in the cupboard 
the stool is about to fall over so he’s probably going to fall on the floor 
his sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the biscuits and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet 
meanwhile their mother is taking no notice 
she’s been washing the dishes and is now drying a plate 
she has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing 
there is a lot of water on the floor and she’s standing in it 
she seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing 
she might be looking out of the window which is open and looks out on the garden 
you can see a path and another part of the house and the lawn flowers and a tree in the garden 
it seems to be summer as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her I forget what you call it 
her son is wearing shorts a shirt and shoes and socks which are also falling down
her daughter is wearing a short skirt and top
there are lots of cupboards all around the kitchen 
there are two cups on the board by the sink
