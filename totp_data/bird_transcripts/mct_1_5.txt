there are two children and their mother in the kitchen 
the little boy has climbed up on a little chair to get something to eat from the up there 
it’s about to fall over so he’s probably going to fall on the floor 
his sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of them and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet
meanwhile their mother is taking no notice 
she’s been washing up and is now drying a plate
she has left the well left the water running and the water is going all over the floor 
there is a lot of water on the floor and she’s standing in it
she seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing 
she might be looking out of the window which is open and looks out on the garden 
you can see a path and another part of the house and the grass flowers and a tree in the garden 
it seems to be summer as she is wearing a summer dress under her I forget what you call it 
her son is wearing short I can’t remember the word a shirt and shoes and little oh things on your feet which are also falling down 
her daughter is wearing a short dress and top 
there are lots of places to keep things all around the kitchen
there are two cups on the board by the lady who is drying up
