there are two children and their mother in the in the room 
the little boy has got up on a a thing to get something from the up there 
it’s about to go over so he’s going to come down
there little girl is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to give her some of them and she’s holding a oh hand to her face as if to tell him to be well not to let their mother hear 
but their mother hasn’t seen them 
she’s been doing jobs in the kitchen and well her mind is on other things 
she has left the well left the water running and the water is going all over the place 
there is a lot of water down there, and she’s standing in it
she seems not to know about both the water and what her children are doing 
she might be looking at something
you can see out to another part of the house and the things out there 
she has got a thing on under her I forget what you call it 
the little boy has got I can’t remember the word and on his feet he has I can’t think of the name little oh things on your feet which are also coming down
the little girl has got a thing on
there are lots of places to keep things all over the room
there are two more things on the side by her where she is working
