there are two children and their mother in the kitchen   
the little boy has climbed up   on a three legged stool to get some cookies from the jar in the cupboard   
the stool is about to fall over   so he’s probably going to fall on the floor   
his sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of the cookies   and she’s holding a finger to her mouth as if to warn her brother to be quiet   
meanwhile their mother is taking no notice   
she’s been doing the washing up and is now drying a plate   
she has left the tap running and the sink is overflowing   
there is a big puddle on the floor   and she’s standing in it   
she seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing   
she might be looking out of the window   which is open and looks out on the garden   
you can see a path and another part of the house and the lawn   flowers   and a tree in the garden   
it seems to be summer   as she is wearing a short sleeved dress under her apron   
her son is wearing shorts a shirt and shoes and socks   which are also falling down   
her daughter is wearing a short skirt and T-shirt  
there are lots of cupboards all around the kitchen   
there are two cups on the draining board
