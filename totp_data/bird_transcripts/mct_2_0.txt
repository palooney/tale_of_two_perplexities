there are two children and their mother in the kitchen 
the little boy has got up on a little sort of chair to get something to eat from the up there 
it’s about to fall over so he’s probably going to fall on the floor 
his sister is holding up one hand as if she is waiting for him to pass her some of them and she’s holding a oh finger to her mouth as if to tell her brother to be well not to let their mother hear
but their mother hasn’t noticed
she’s been doing jobs in the kitchen and well her mind is on other things 
she has left the well left the water running and the water is going all over the floor 
there is a lot of water on the floor and she’s standing in it
she seems not to have noticed either the water or what her children are doing 
she might be looking out of the window which is open and looks out on the garden 
you can see a road and another part of the house and the garden and a tree in the garden 
it seems to be summer as she is wearing a summer summer clothes under her I forget what you call it 
her son is wearing shorts 
i can’t remember the word and on his feet he has I forget the name little oh things on your feet which are also falling down
her daughter is wearing a short thing 
there are lots of places to keep things all around the kitchen 
there are two more things on the board by the lady who is working
